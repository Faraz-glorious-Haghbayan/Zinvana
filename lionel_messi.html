    <!-- Early Life & Family Background -->
    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life &amp; Family Background</h2>
      <p>
        Born to Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and Celia Cuccittini, a part-time cleaner, Lionel was the third of four children. From a young age, he displayed extraordinary control on the dusty pitches of Rosario. Diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency at age 10, his family moved to Barcelona in 2000 after FC Barcelona offered to pay his medical treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        His grandmother, Celia, instilled in him a love of football and unwavering support. Away from the game, he was reserved, immersing himself in practice sessions at La Masia’s small-sided futsal courts, where his low center of gravity and tight dribbling were honed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite homesickness, he excelled academically, learning Spanish vernacular and Catalan, and quickly adapted to life in Europe, foreshadowing a trajectory that would redefine global football.
      </p>

    <!-- Youth Career at La Masia -->
    <section id="youth-masia">
      <h2>Youth Career at La Masia (2000–2004)</h2>
      <p>
        Progressing from the Infantil A to Juvenil B squads, Messi’s statistics were staggering: 235 goals in 175 matches across age groups. Under legendary youth coaches like Jordi Roura, he mastered the Barça style—rapid passing, spatial awareness, and relentless pressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        He debuted for Barcelona’s “C” team at 16 and trained occasionally with the first team, learning from the likes of Ronaldinho, whom he idolized and who became his early mentor on and off the pitch.

    <section id="barcelona-career">
      <h2>FC Barcelona Senior Team (2004–2021)</h2>
      <p>
        Making his official first-team debut in October 2004, Messi gradually established himself under Frank Rijkaard, but it was Pep Guardiola’s arrival in 2008 that catalyzed his rise to superstardom. Forming a quintet with Xavi, Iniesta, Villa, and Pedro, he scored 672 goals in 778 appearances, winning 10 La Liga titles, 7 Copa del Rey trophies, and 4 UEFA Champions League titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        His 2011–12 season stands out: 73 goals across all competitions, including a record 50 in La Liga. With uncanny balance, he scored solo slaloms and free-kick masterpieces, often deciding El Clásico and Champions League finals single-handedly.
