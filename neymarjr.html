    <!-- Early Life & Family Background -->
    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life &amp; Family Background</h2>
      <p>
        Neymar was born to former footballer Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo. His father, a semi-professional forward, named him after the legendary Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff’s birth city, inspiring his own ambitions. At age four, Neymar joined the Portuguesa Santista youth side, honing his technique and flair in small-sided games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite economic challenges, his family supported his passion. He often practiced free-kicks against makeshift goalposts, watched tapes of Ronaldinho and Robinho, and imitated their tricks in local futsal halls. His siblings Rafaella and Davi became his early training partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 11, he entered the Santos FC academy, earning the nickname “O Menino da Vila” (The Village Boy) for his humility and prodigious talent. Coaches recall his tireless work ethic: extra sessions at dawn and late-night street practice.
      </p>

    <!-- Youth Career & Santos Breakthrough -->
    <section id="santos-youth">
      <h2>Santos FC (2003–2013)</h2>
      <p>
        Progressing rapidly through youth ranks, Neymar debuted for Santos’ first team in March 2009 at 17, scoring in his third appearance. His flair and goals attracted national media: 42 goals in 60 appearances during the 2010–11 season earned him the South American Footballer of the Year award.
      </p>
      <p>
        He led Santos to the 2011 Copa Libertadores title—the club’s first in 48 years—scoring twice in the two-legged final against Peñarol, including a trademark dribble and finish that became iconic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite offers from Europe, Neymar extended his Santos contract in 2011, citing loyalty to the club that shaped him, while continuing to refine his passing range and tactical understanding under manager Muricy Ramalho.
      </p>
      <p>Key highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>2011 Copa Libertadores Winner</li>
          <li>2010 & 2011 South American Footballer of the Year</li>

    <!-- FC Barcelona (2013–2017) -->
    <section id="barcelona">
      <h2>FC Barcelona (2013–2017)</h2>
      <p>
        In summer 2013, Neymar joined Barcelona to form the legendary “MSN” trio alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez. He made his debut in October, scoring his first La Liga goal days later. Over four seasons he contributed 105 goals and 80 assists in 186 appearances.
      </p>
      <p>
        His 2014–15 campaign was historic: 39 goals, 10 assists, and a treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and UEFA Champions League titles. His match-winning brace in the Copa del Rey final and crucial strike in the Champions League semi-final underscored his big-game temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        He adapted to tiki-taka demands—improving his one-touch passing and defensive pressing—while retaining his daring dribble and flair. Off the pitch, he endeared himself to fans with charity work in Catalonia’s favelas.

      </p>
      <p>
        His partnership with Kylian Mbappé and Ángel Di María yielded prolific attacking displays. Despite injuries, he delivered moments of brilliance: last-gasp free-kick against Lyon, solo run in the Champions League quarter-finals, and record-breaking scoring streak across competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In February 2023 he overtook Zlatan Ibrahimović as PSG’s second-highest scorer, showcasing career longevity. He also guided PSG to their first-ever Champions League final in 2020, finishing runner-up.

    <!-- Playing Style & Technical Attributes -->
    <section id="playing-style">
      <h2>Playing Style &amp; Technical Attributes</h2>
      <h3>Dribbling & Flair</h3>
      <p>
        Neymar’s combination of step-overs, nutmegs, and body feints dazzles defenders. His low centre of gravity and quick feet allow rapid changes of direction, making him virtually unplayable in one-on-ones.
      </p>
      <h3>Vision & Creativity</h3>
      <p>
        Equally adept as playmaker, his through-balls and flicks unlock tight defences. He often drops deep to orchestrate attacks, linking midfield and front-line with incisive passes.
      </p>
      <h3>Finishing & Free Kicks</h3>
      <p>
        His repertoire includes curled long-range strikes, precise chips, and powerful drive finishes. His free-kick technique—mixing power and spin—yields spectacular goals.
      </p>
      <h3>Work Rate & Pressing</h3>
      <p>
        In modern tactical setups, Neymar engages in counter-press and defensive tracking, balancing flair with responsibility, though that has evolved as he matured into a more disciplined role.
