    <!-- 1. Early Life and Family Background -->
    <h2>Early Life and Family Background</h2>
    <p>
      Nelson Mandela was born in Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, into the Thembu royal family. His upbringing in a rural setting and exposure to traditional Xhosa culture played a significant role in shaping his identity and worldview. Mandela's early experiences with tribal customs and the hardships of rural life instilled in him a deep commitment to justice and social equality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up amid the complexities of colonial rule, he witnessed firsthand the injustices imposed by a segregated society. These early experiences planted the seeds for his lifelong struggle against oppression and inequality.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. Education and Early Influences -->
    <h2>Education and Early Influences</h2>
    <p>
      Mandela attended local schools in the rural villages of the Eastern Cape, where he excelled academically despite the challenges posed by a segregated education system. His determination led him to pursue higher education at the University of Fort Hare, where he encountered new ideas and began to question the status quo. Later, he completed his studies through correspondence courses while working and became a key figure in the struggle against apartheid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Influenced by socialist and African nationalist ideologies, as well as his own strong Christian beliefs, Mandela developed a commitment to nonviolent protest. His education and early political engagements laid the foundation for his future role as an activist and leader in the civil rights movement.
    </p>

    <!-- 3. Activism and the Fight Against Apartheid -->
    <h2>Activism and the Fight Against Apartheid</h2>
    <p>
      In the 1940s, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC), actively participating in the organized opposition to the oppressive apartheid regime. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent voice for human rights and equality in South Africa. His dedication to challenging racial segregation through nonviolent means, and later through armed struggle when necessary, galvanized widespread support among black South Africans.
    </p>
    <p>
      His early activism laid the groundwork for a mass movement that would eventually lead to significant political and social reforms, making him an enduring symbol of the struggle for freedom.
    </p>

    <!-- 4. Imprisonment and the Years of Resistance -->
    <h2>Imprisonment and the Years of Resistance</h2>
    <p>
      In 1962, Mandela was arrested and later sentenced to life imprisonment for his involvement in anti-apartheid activities. During his 27 years behind bars, he became a global symbol of resistance to racial injustice. His steadfast determination, even under harsh conditions, not only earned him international respect but also bolstered the resolve of those fighting for freedom in South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandela's imprisonment became a rallying point for the anti-apartheid movement worldwide, leading to increasing international pressure on the South African government to reform its discriminatory policies.

      In the 1990s, as domestic and international pressures mounted, Mandela was released from prison in 1990. His subsequent efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid were characterized by his commitment to reconciliation and dialogue. Working with political leaders from all sides, Mandela helped to steer South Africa through a peaceful transition from a racially segregated society to a democratic nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      These negotiations culminated in South Africa's first multiracial elections in 1994, which Mandela won, becoming the country’s first black president and symbolizing a new era of unity and hope.
    </p>

    <!-- 6. Presidency and Reconciliation Efforts -->
    <h2>Presidency and Reconciliation Efforts</h2>
    <p>
      As president from 1994 to 1999, Mandela focused on national reconciliation, dismantling the institutional framework of apartheid, and building a society based on equality and justice. His administration worked to repair the wounds of segregation by promoting policies of inclusivity, economic empowerment, and social reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandela’s emphasis on forgiveness and understanding—embodied in the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission—played a vital role in healing a deeply divided nation and fostering a new spirit of unity among South Africans.
