    <h2>Early Life of Khosrow I</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow I, later acclaimed “Anushirvan” (the Immortal Soul), was born in 519 CE in Ardabil, the son of Hormizd IV. Raised at the Sassanian court, he studied Zoroastrian theology, Persian law, and statecraft under the grand magi and senior satraps. As prince, he administered the Khorasan frontier, gaining experience in military leadership and governance.
    </p>

    <h2>Accession of Khosrow I to the Sassanian Throne</h2>
    <p>
      In 531 CE, following the assassination of Hormizd IV and a brief reign by Kavadh I, Khosrow I was installed by powerful nobles. He secured his position by eliminating rival claimants, restoring central authority, and winning popular support through promises of justice and reform.
    </p>

    <h2>Khosrow I’s Legal and Administrative Reforms</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow I overhauled Sassanian justice with the famous “Mīrānshāhān Law Code,” ensuring equitable taxation and transparent courts. He restructured provincial governance, placing royal inspectors (dastbēgs) over satraps and standardizing coinage. His motto, “Justice brings prosperity,” guided policies that reduced corruption and enhanced state revenue.
    </p>

    <h2>Military Campaigns of Khosrow I</h2>
    <p>
      Determined to reclaim Sasanian prestige, Khosrow I led campaigns against the Byzantines and Hephthalites. From 540–562 CE, he captured Antioch, raided Constantinople’s suburbs, and secured the eastern frontier by defeating the White Huns at Hyrcania. These victories expanded Sassanian influence and forced favorable treaties with Byzantium.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural and Intellectual Patronage under Khosrow I</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow I founded the celebrated Academy of Gondishapur, inviting Greek, Indian, and Nestorian scholars. He sponsored translations of scientific, medical, and philosophical works into Middle Persian. Court poets recorded his exploits in epic verse, forging the Sassanian literary canon.
    </p>

    <h2>Religious Policy and Suppression of Extremism</h2>
    <p>
      While championing Zoroastrian orthodoxy, Khosrow I curbed the radical Mazdakite movement, which threatened aristocratic landholdings and social order. He granted limited tolerance to Christian and Jewish communities but ensured the magi maintained their privileged role in governance and education.
    </p>

    <h2>Architectural and Infrastructural Achievements of Khosrow I</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow I commissioned the Gorgan Wall—an 185-km defensive barrier against northern nomads—and rebuilt the palace at Ctesiphon with lavish mosaics. He improved irrigation canals in Khuzestan and constructed caravanserais along the Silk Road, facilitating trade between East and West.
    </p>

    <h2>Khosrow I in Historical Sources</h2>
    <p>
      Byzantine historian Procopius praises Khosrow I as “the greatest of kings” in his *Wars*. Persian court chronicles and the Chronicle of Khuzistan document his reforms. Numismatic evidence and archaeological finds at Ctesiphon, Susa, and Gundeshapur corroborate his building programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Death of Khosrow I and Succession</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow I died in 587 CE of natural causes at Ctesiphon. His son Hormizd IV briefly succeeded him before turmoil ensued. Nonetheless, Khosrow’s reforms and cultural foundations endured, influencing both Sassanian successors and early Islamic governance.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy and Modern Appraisal of Khosrow I</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow I’s reign marks the zenith of the Sassanian “Golden Age.” His legal codes inspired later Middle Eastern jurisprudence, and Gondishapur became a beacon of learning for centuries. Modern historians view him as an archetype of wise rulership and cultural synthesis.
