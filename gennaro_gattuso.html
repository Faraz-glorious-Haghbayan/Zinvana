        <!-- Early Life & Family -->
    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life & Family Background</h2>
      <p>
        Gennaro Ivan Gattuso was born on January 9, 1978 in Corigliano Calabro, a fishing village in Calabria, southern Italy. His father, Giovanni, worked long days at sea, while his mother, Maria, managed the stall at the town market. As the eldest of three brothers—Pasquale and Salvatore—“Rino” quickly assumed responsibility in their modest home. The family’s meager means meant his earliest footballs were bundles of rags, and he often played barefoot on uneven cobblestones.
      </p>
      <p>
        From age five, street football was Rino’s classroom: he learned improvisation, balance, and resilience by taking on players much larger than himself. Neighbors recall his fierce competitiveness, how he’d shadow taller kids without fear, and never back down from a challenge. His mother once chased him home, worried by his cuts and bruises, only to find him beaming—he’d just stolen the ball from a local youth team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education came secondary to football. His teachers recall he’d practice step-overs in hallways, dribble through desks at recess, and challenge classmates to foot races. By 12, Gattuso was scouted at a regional youth tournament in Cosenza; scouts noted his “insane work-rate” and “sixth sense” for reading the game. At 14, he moved 200 miles north to join Salernitana’s youth academy, leaving his family behind and adapting to life in a boarding house—truly the formative crucible of his legendary mental toughness.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Youth Career at Salernitana -->
    <section id="salernitana-youth">
      <h2>Youth Career at Salernitana</h2>
      <p>
        In 1992, Salernitana’s academy welcomed Gattuso as its youngest recruit. His first coach, Luigi Di Somma, recalls Rino arriving at 5 a.m. before dawn, determined to outlast all teammates in fitness drills. Early sessions focused on endurance laps, tackling technique on tackle dummies, and video study of classic midfield battles—rare for a teenager.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1994 he dominated the under-16 league, averaging a league-leading 3.2 tackles per game and captaining the side to the Campania Under-17 Championship. His signature “burst into challenge” move—where he’d time a forward’s first touch and slide in with surgical precision—became a talking point among rival coaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summer 1995, he featured in senior-team friendlies against Serie A clubs, impressing with his vocal presence and willingness to chase every loose ball. Although still just 17, he earned a professional contract that fall. Academy director Francesco Cordova later said, “No one took Gattuso’s small stature as a weakness—he played as if every tackle was a life-or-death battle.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Salernitana (1995–1999) -->
    <section id="salernitana">
      <h2>Salernitana (1995–1999)</h2>
      <p>
        Gattuso made his Serie B debut on August 24, 1995 against Ravenna, coming on at 70' to shore up midfield. Over four seasons, he accumulated 69 appearances and scored twice—both from late-game set-piece scrambles where his tenacity shone brightest. In the 1997–98 promotion campaign, he logged a staggering 90% tackle success rate, according to club analysts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond raw stats, teammates noted his relentless shuttling between defensive and offensive zones—covering 12 km per match, unheard of for a teenager in mid-90s Italian football. Coach Alberto Bigon credited Gattuso’s work-rate as pivotal in Salernitana reaching the promotion playoffs for the first time in club history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite relegation in 1999, his reputation soared. Scouts from AC Milan, Juventus, and Roma filed reports on his “motor that never stops” and “mind like a steel trap.” In July 1999, Milan secured his transfer for €8.5 million—a record fee for a Serie B talent at the time.
      </p>
      <p>Key highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>69 appearances, 2 goals</li>
          <li>Instrumental in 1997–98 Serie B promotion push (90% tackle success)</li>
          <li>Named Serie B Breakthrough Player: 1998</li>
          <li>Average distance covered per match: 11.8 km</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <!-- AC Milan (1999–2012) -->
    <section id="milan">
      <h2>AC Milan (1999–2012)</h2>
      <p>
        Arriving at San Siro in July 1999, Gattuso initially fell behind Milan’s established midfielders. A short loan to Rangers in late 1999–2000 toughened him further. Returning under Carlo Ancelotti in 2000, he capitalized on injuries to cement the No. 8 role by 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 13 seasons, he notched 339 league appearances and six goals—but his true value lay in his intangible leadership. He captained Milan in 120 matches, often rallying the side in doldrums. Key seasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2002–03:</strong> Integral in defensive midfield, shielding Cafu and Maldini, as Milan won the Champions League—his crunch tackle on Rui Costa in the final underpinned the victory.</li>
        <li><strong>2004–05:</strong> Voted Milan’s “Player’s Player” for core work-rate and transitional play on way to La Liga-style season.</li>
        <li><strong>2006–07:</strong> Part of the midfield triumvirate with Pirlo and Seedorf, earning him a second Champions League medal.</li>
        <li><strong>2010–11 & 2011–12:</strong> Late-career resurgence, helping Milan reclaim the Scudetto in 2011 and deliver veteran stability amid squad transition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Persistent ankle injuries emerged in 2011, limiting his pace but never his spirit. He mentored youth prospects—De Sciglio, Poli—imparting the art of the “perfect tackle.” In December 2011, he moved on loan to Sion before officially hanging up his boots in May 2013.
      </p>
      <p>Key highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>UEFA Champions League: 2002–03, 2006–07</li>
          <li>Serie A: 2003–04, 2010–11</li>
          <li>Coppa Italia: 2002–03, 2006–07</li>
          <li>UEFA Super Cup: 2003, 2007</li>
          <li>339 league appearances, 6 goals</li>
          <li>120 matches as vice-captain</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Rangers (1999–2000) -->
    <section id="rangers">
      <h2>Rangers (1999–2000, loan)</h2>
      <p>
        Loaned to Rangers in November 1999, Gattuso made nine Scottish Premier League appearances, helping secure the 1999–2000 title. His trademark late-challenge tackle against Motherwell and tireless box-to-box runs earned him the nickname “The Calabrian Engine.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Off the pitch, he embraced the Glasgow culture—learning basic Scots Gaelic phrases and becoming a regular at Ibrox fan forums. The stint bolstered his physicality, preparing him to face Serie A’s elite.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sion (2011–2012, loan) & Retirement -->
    <section id="sion">
      <h2>Sion (2011–2012, loan) &amp; Retirement</h2>
      <p>
        In December 2011, amid recurring ankle pain, Gattuso joined Swiss Super League side Sion on loan. Over 15 appearances, he scored once—a thunderous long-range drive against Grasshopper Zürich—and provided veteran leadership to a young squad.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 2013, age 35 and citing chronic injuries, he announced his retirement. Milan’s official statement lauded him as “the heart and soul of our midfield for over a decade.” The farewell at San Siro drew a capacity crowd, underscoring his impact.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- International Career with Italy -->
    <section id="international">
      <h2>International Career with Italy</h2>
      <p>
        Gattuso earned his first Italy cap on March 28, 2000, vs. Greece. Over a decade, he collected 73 caps, scoring once (a header in Euro 2004 qualifier vs. Slovenia). He formed the midfield backbone with Pirlo and De Rossi under Marcello Lippi.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, his tireless closing down and fierce tackle on Zé Roberto in the quarterfinals became defining moments. He completed the tournament with an average of 9.3 tackles per game, anchoring Italy’s run to the title. He also featured at Euro 2004, the 2002 and 2010 World Cups, and captained the side in friendly matches in 2010.
      </p>
      <p>Key highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>73 caps, 1 goal</li>
          <li>FIFA World Cup Winner: 2006</li>
