    <!-- Early Life & Family Background -->
    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life & Family Background</h2>
      <p>
        Born to Wilfried and Fayza Mbappé in the Parisian suburb of Bondy, Kylian grew up in a sporting household; his father was a football coach and former handball player, while his mother played professional handball. Alongside his older brother Jirès and younger adopted brother Ethan, Kylian was introduced to sport at an early age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blessed with explosive pace, he honed his skills on local concrete pitches and indoor halls, often outpacing older opponents. Coaches remember his relentless work ethic: running drills before and after team sessions, studying video footage of Eden Hazard and Thierry Henry to emulate their movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Excelling academically, he balanced school with intense training, joining AS Bondy’s youth setup at age six. Demonstrating leadership, he captained older age groups before catching the eye of scouts from the Clairefontaine academy at 13, a prestigious incubator for French talent.

      </p>
      <p>
        Promoted to the reserve side at 16, he continued his goal-scoring exploits, leading the CFA 2 in goals (11 in 12 games). His ability to change direction at full speed and his composure in front of goal earned him comparisons to France legend Thierry Henry.
