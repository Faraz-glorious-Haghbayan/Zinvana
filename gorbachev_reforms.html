    <!-- 1. INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Mikhail Gorbachev’s reform era began on March 11, 1985, when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.  
      He inherited a Soviet Union suffering from economic stagnation, bureaucratic sclerosis, and growing public discontent.  
      Determined to revive socialism through renewal rather than repression, he launched an unprecedented series of reforms—
      Perestroika, Glasnost, and Demokratizatsiya—backed by his concept of “New Thinking” in international affairs.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT -->
    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      By the early 1980s, the Soviet planned economy was faltering: agricultural output lagged, consumer shortages were rampant,  
      and technological innovation lagged behind the West. The Brezhnev era’s policy of “stability without reform” had exhausted its vitality.  
      Meanwhile, the war in Afghanistan and the arms race placed further strain on the budget.  
      Internationally, détente had stalled, and the USSR faced diplomatic isolation after the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.
    </p>

    <!-- 3. GORBACHEV’S RISE TO POWER -->
    <h2>Gorbachev’s Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>
      Born in rural Stavropol, Gorbachev rose through regional party ranks by implementing efficiency drives on collective farms.  
      In 1978 he joined the Politburo, and following Andropov’s and Chernenko’s brief tenures,  
      his generational shift and reformist reputation made him the consensus choice in 1985.  
      His leadership style combined legal–constitutional arguments for change with personal charisma.

    <!-- 4. PERESTROIKA (Restructuring) -->
    <h2>Perestroika (Restructuring)</h2>
    <p>
      Announced in late 1986, Perestroika aimed to decentralize economic decision–making,  
      introduce profit incentives, and attract foreign investment. State enterprises gained limited autonomy,  
      cooperatives emerged in services, and joint ventures with Western companies began.  
      However, shortages worsened initially as planners adapted to new signals.

    <!-- 5. GLASNOST (Openness) -->
    <h2>Glasnost (Openness)</h2>
    <p>
      Glasnost lifted bans on press criticism, released political prisoners, and exposed Stalinist abuses.  
      Newspapers ran investigative reports on Chernobyl, GULAG archives were opened, and public debates flourished.  
      This transparency stimulated civic engagement but also fueled nationalist movements in the republics.

    <!-- 6. DEMOKRATIZATSIYA (Democratization) -->
    <h2>Demokratizatsiya (Democratization)</h2>
    <p>
      In 1988 Gorbachev introduced multi-candidate elections for the new Congress of People’s Deputies.  
      Political pluralism emerged within the Communist Party and across non-party associations.  
      Citizens could openly vote on local councils for the first time since the 1920s.
    </p>

    <!-- 7. NEW THINKING IN FOREIGN POLICY -->
    <h2>New Thinking in Foreign Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Gorbachev’s “New Thinking” replaced zero-sum confrontation with common security.  
      He withdrew troops from Afghanistan, reduced troops in Eastern Europe, signed the INF Treaty (1987),  
      and engaged in summit diplomacy with Reagan, moving beyond deterrence to cooperative security.

    <!-- 8. IMPACT ON THE SOVIET ECONOMY -->
    <h2>Impact on the Soviet Economy</h2>
    <p>
      While some industrial sectors saw efficiency gains, overall GDP growth remained weak, and inflation rose.  
      The dual-track pricing system and supply disruptions created public frustration.  
      Nevertheless, Perestroika laid groundwork for later market transitions in post-Soviet states.

    <!-- 9. SOCIAL AND CULTURAL EFFECTS -->
    <h2>Social and Cultural Effects</h2>
    <p>
      Glasnost unleashed a cultural renaissance: literature, cinema, and the arts explored taboo topics.  
      Social organizations—environmental groups, perestroika cooperatives—multiplied.  
      The Soviet intelligentsia regained its voice and pushed for broader reforms.
    </p>
    <!-- (Add ~800 more words on art, music, civic groups, and social challenges) -->

    <!-- 10. REACTIONS AND RESISTANCE -->
    <h2>Reactions and Resistance</h2>
    <p>
      Conservative elements in the Politburo and KGB resisted reforms, fearing loss of control.  
      Hardliners staged the August 1991 coup attempt.  
      Yet popular support for Gorbachev’s policies and Yeltsin’s leadership in Moscow thwarted the putsch.
    </p>
    <!-- (Add ~800 more words on party debates, the coup’s planning, and public response) -->

    <!-- 11. COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION -->
    <h2>Collapse of the Soviet Union</h2>
    <p>
      Between 1990–1991, republics declared sovereignty, the Baltic states pressed for independence,  
      and economic collapse accelerated. Gorbachev resigned December 25, 1991,  
      marking the official end of the USSR and the birth of 15 independent states.
    </p>

    <!-- 12. LEGACY OF GORBACHEV’S REFORMS -->
    <h2>Legacy of Gorbachev’s Reforms</h2>
    <p>
      Gorbachev’s bold policies reshaped global politics, ending the Cold War peacefully.  
      His legacy remains contested: praised for freedom and peace, criticized for economic turmoil.  
      Yet his example influences reformers worldwide.
    </p>

    <!-- 13. CONCLUSION -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Mikhail Gorbachev’s reform era demonstrates both the potential and perils of rapid change within an entrenched system.  
      Perestroika, Glasnost, and Demokratizatsiya irrevocably altered the Soviet Union and the world.  
      His vision of openness, dialogue, and cooperative security continues to inspire—and to warn.
