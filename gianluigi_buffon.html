    <!-- Early Life & Family -->
    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life & Family Background</h2>
      <p>
        Gianluigi “Gigi” Buffon was born into a sporting family in Carrara, Tuscany. His father, Adriano, was a professional footballer turned manager, while his mother, Maria Stella, supported his early passion for sport. Growing up with siblings, Buffon often accompanied his father to training sessions, absorbing tactical insights. The rocky hills of Tuscany served as his first playground—he honed his reflexes by catching stray balls thrown down steep inclines and practiced diving into piles of leaves to soften landings.
      </p>
      <p>
        A reserved child with an early love for competition, Buffon excelled at multiple sports—handball, basketball, and volleyball—developing exceptional hand-eye coordination. Teachers remember him as disciplined, often arriving early to school to read sports magazines and draw goalkeeper positioning diagrams. Parish priests recall his dedication to community football evenings, where he volunteered to coach younger children, laying the groundwork for his future leadership qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age nine, Buffon joined the local club Alma Juventus F.C., balancing schooling with twice-weekly training sessions. By 12, his towering frame and natural shot-stopping ability caught the attention of Pisa SC’s scouts, leading to a scholarship to their youth academy. The move required Buffon to commute over 100 km weekly, demonstrating early sacrifice and persistence that would define his career.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Youth Career at Parma -->
    <section id="youth-parma">
      <h2>Youth Career at Parma</h2>
      <p>
        In 1991, Buffon signed with Parma’s renowned youth academy, celebrated for producing Italian talents. Under coach Nevio Scala, he refined his fundamentals—positioning, footwork, and distribution. Scala’s unorthodox training drills, involving unpredictable rebounds off angled boards, instilled in Buffon an anticipation for erratic match situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 16, he captained Parma’s Primavera squad to the 1994 Campionato Nazionale Primavera final, recording eight clean sheets in the tournament. Sporting directors noted his composure under pressure—he famously saved two penalties in a semifinal shootout, earning praise in Gazzetta dello Sport.
      </p>
      <p>
        His promotion to first-team training at 17 placed him alongside veterans such as Luca Bucci and Alberto Fontana. Observing their routines—nutrition, film-study, and recovery—Buffon adopted professional habits early. His senior debut arrived in November 1995, in a Coppa Italia match against Sampdoria, where he produced a series of reflex saves to secure a draw.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Parma (1995–2001) -->
    <section id="parma">
      <h2>Parma (1995–2001)</h2>
      <p>
        Buffon established himself as Parma’s first-choice goalkeeper in the 1995–96 Serie A season at 17, becoming the youngest starting keeper in Italian top-flight history. He made 34 league appearances, boasting 12 clean sheets, and helped Parma finish sixth—their best result in a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under manager Carlo Ancelotti, Buffon won his first major honours: the 1998–99 Coppa Italia and the 1999 UEFA Cup, excelling in key matches. In the 1999 Coppa Italia final, he kept a clean sheet in both legs against Fiorentina, making crucial saves from Gabriel Batistuta.
      </p>
      <p>
        His 2000–01 campaign was arguably his best at Parma: 41 appearances across all competitions, 15 clean sheets, and a club-record sequence of 790 consecutive minutes without conceding. These performances sparked interest from Europe’s elite, culminating in Juventus securing his transfer for €52 million—the highest fee ever for a goalkeeper at that time.
      </p>
      <p>Key highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>1998–99 Coppa Italia winner</li>
          <li>1998–99 UEFA Cup winner</li>
          <li>41 appearances, 15 clean sheets (2000–01)</li>
          <li>790 minutes unbeaten run—a club record</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Juventus (2001–2018) -->
    <section id="juventus">
      <h2>Juventus FC (2001–2018)</h2>
      <p>
        Buffon’s arrival at Juventus in July 2001 marked the beginning of a legendary 17-year tenure. Immediately installed as first-choice under manager Marcello Lippi, he made 33 league appearances in his debut Serie A season, recording 14 clean sheets and helping Juventus finish second.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next decade, Buffon won nine Serie A titles (later reduced to seven after Calciopoli), five Coppa Italia trophies, and the 2006 UEFA Champions League final runner-up spot. His performance in the 2005–06 season earned him the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award and his first IFFHS World’s Best Goalkeeper accolade.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2011–12, Buffon captained Juventus to their first Scudetto in five years, lifting the trophy after a 23-year drought. That season, he conceded just 20 goals in 38 league games, setting a modern Serie A record for fewest goals conceded. His leadership off the pitch was equally vital—mentoring young keepers Wojciech Szczęsny and Carlo Pinsoglio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Juventus reaching the Champions League final in 2015 and 2017 (both losses to Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively), Buffon’s world-class form earned him the UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year in 2017. He departed Juventus in 2018 having made 509 Serie A appearances and 685 in all competitions, cementing his status as the club’s all-time most capped player.
      </p>
      <p>Key highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>9× Serie A titles (2001–08, 2012–18)</li>
          <li>5× Coppa Italia titles</li>
          <li>700+ appearances for Juventus</li>

    <section id="psg">
      <h2>Paris Saint-Germain (2018–2019)</h2>
      <p>
        In July 2018, Buffon joined PSG on a one-year deal seeking Champions League success. He made 31 appearances across all competitions, winning Ligue 1 and Coupe de France. His veteran presence stabilized PSG’s defense—aided by Marquinhos and Thiago Silva—and he recorded 17 league clean sheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite PSG’s quarterfinal exit in the Champions League, Buffon’s professionalism and mentorship of younger keepers like Alphonse Areola drew praise. He delivered a farewell message at Parc des Princes: “This chapter ends, but my passion endures,” before returning to Juventus for one final season.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Return to Juventus & Retirement (2019–2023) -->
    <section id="return-retirement">
      <h2>Return to Juventus &amp; Retirement (2019–2023)</h2>
      <p>
        Buffon re-signed with Juventus in June 2019, initially as backup to Wojciech Szczęsny. He made 17 appearances in 2019–20, including a memorable clean sheet on his Coppa Italia return. In 2020, he equaled Paolo Maldini’s record 648 Serie A appearances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2021–22 season marked his 20th top-flight campaign. At 44, Buffon set the record as the oldest goalkeeper to play in the Champions League (45 years, 161 days). He announced his final retirement in May 2023 with an emotional farewell at Allianz Stadium, concluding an unprecedented 29-year professional career.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- International Career with Italy -->
    <section id="international">
      <h2>International Career with Italy</h2>
      <p>
        Buffon made his Italy debut in October 1997 at 19, in a friendly against Uruguay. Selected for Euro 2000, he rose to prominence at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where his heroic saves—especially in the quarterfinal penalty shootout vs. Australia—earned him the Yashin Award as tournament’s best keeper. He lifted the World Cup in Berlin, conceding only two goals in seven matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 20 years, he earned 176 caps—an international record for a goalkeeper—and featured in five World Cups and four European Championships. He captained Italy from 2010, leading them to Euro 2012 final. His final appearance came in June 2018 against Sweden, concluding a storied international tenure.

      <h3>Shot-Stopping & Reflexes</h3>
      <p>
        Buffon’s hallmark is his explosive reflexes, capable of fingertip saves at close range. His reaction time—0.2 seconds to dive—set him apart, allowing him to thwart shots other keepers would concede.
      </p>
      <h3>Positioning & Command of Area</h3>

        He possessed unrivalled positional sense, cutting angles and sweeping behind a high defensive line. His authority in claiming crosses—timing leaps to perfection—solidified defenses.
