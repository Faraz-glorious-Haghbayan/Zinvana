    <!-- Historical Biography Content -->
    <h2>Early Life and Influences</h2>
    <p>
      Vladimir Lenin was born into a middle-class family in Simbirsk, Russia. Exposed early to revolutionary ideas through family experiences and revolutionary literature, he developed a keen sense of injustice that would later fuel his commitment to overthrowing the tsarist autocracy.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Bolshevik Revolution</h2>
    <p>
      Lenin emerged as a pivotal figure during the turbulent years leading up to the 1917 Russian Revolution. His leadership and strategic vision helped mobilize the Bolsheviks, ultimately leading to the dismantling of the old regime and the establishment of a socialist state.
    </p>
    
    <h2>State-Building and Marxist-Leninist Theory</h2>
    <p>
      As the head of the new Soviet government, Lenin implemented radical reforms aimed at redistributing wealth and establishing a planned economy. His theoretical works and practical policies laid the foundation for Marxist-Leninist ideology, which would shape global politics for much of the 20th century.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Leninâ€™s ideas and actions have left an enduring mark on world history. His role in igniting revolutionary movements, redefining state power, and challenging established economic and political systems continues to be both celebrated and debated by scholars and political thinkers worldwide.

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>How did Lenin adapt Marxist theory to the conditions of Russia?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
