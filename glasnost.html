    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Glasnost (“openness”) was Mikhail Gorbachev’s flagship policy aiming to inject transparency into Soviet governance,
      awaken civic participation, and confront past injustices. Announced in 1986 alongside Perestroika, Glasnost
      shattered decades of censorship and fear, unleashing a torrent of public debate, investigative journalism,
      and artistic renewal.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. Origins of Glasnost -->
    <h2>Origins of Glasnost</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of Glasnost had roots in earlier Soviet calls for criticism and correction,
      but under Gorbachev it became a systematic opening of state archives, press freedoms,
      and political discussion. By examining the USSR’s structural stagnation, Gorbachev and his advisors
      concluded that only transparency could create the pressure needed for meaningful reform.
    </p>

    <!-- 3. Implementation and Key Measures -->
    <h2>Implementation and Key Measures</h2>
    <p>
      From relaxed censorship laws to televised Politburo debates, Glasnost’s rollout was both rapid and uneven.
      Major newspapers like Pravda and Izvestia were empowered to publish critiques of local officials,
      while new independent journals such as Ogonyok emerged. The 1987 Law on State Enterprise
      even mandated public reporting of economic and environmental data.
    </p>

    <!-- 4. Impact on Media and Culture -->
    <h2>Impact on Media and Culture</h2>
    <p>
      Journalists investigated Chernobyl’s cover-up, historians published works on Stalin’s purges,
      and filmmakers tackled taboo subjects. Theatres staged previously banned plays, underground rock bands
      played openly, and the Soviet public consumed foreign literature in record numbers.
    </p>

    <!-- 5. Political and Social Effects -->
    <h2>Political and Social Effects</h2>
    <p>
      Glasnost loosened the Communist Party’s monopoly on truth, enabling opposition groups
      and nationalist movements in the Baltics, Ukraine, and the Caucasus. Citizens voted in
      the 1989 Congress of People’s Deputies election, and open town-hall meetings became commonplace.
    </p>

    <!-- 6. Economic Ramifications -->
    <h2>Economic Ramifications</h2>
    <p>
      By exposing inefficiencies and corruption, Glasnost fueled public demand for economic reform.
      Worker protests over unpaid wages and buyer-seller cooperatives expanded. Businesses began publishing
      audited accounts, setting the stage for Perestroika’s market experiments.
    </p>

    <!-- 7. Criticisms and Unintended Consequences -->
    <h2>Criticisms and Unintended Consequences</h2>
    <p>
      While Glasnost energized debate, it also unleashed ethno-territorial conflicts in the Caucasus
      and Baltic calls for secession. Economic transparency without price reforms contributed to shortages
      and inflation. Hardliners accused Gorbachev of betraying socialism, leading to the 1991 coup attempt.
    </p>

    <!-- 8. Glasnost in Foreign Relations -->
    <h2>Glasnost in Foreign Relations</h2>
    <p>
      Openness extended to the USSR’s diplomatic posture: Soviet archives on WWII were opened to the West;
      foreign correspondents reported from Moscow freely; and Gorbachev invited Western media to broadcast
      from Red Square, reshaping global perceptions of the superpower.
    </p>

    <!-- 9. Long-Term Legacy -->
    <h2>Long-Term Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Glasnost’s dismantling of information barriers transformed not only the USSR but inspired democratic
      reformers worldwide. Post-Soviet states inherited a tradition of investigative journalism and civil society
      activism. Yet the same openness also fragmented the Union, illustrating the double-edged nature of transparency.
    </p>

    <!-- 10. Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      As one of the most dramatic political experiments of the 20th century, Glasnost under Gorbachev
      remains a powerful case study in the potentials and perils of openness. It demonstrated that
      truth can be liberating—but only if accompanied by robust institutions capable of managing change.

    <p>
      Glasnost transformed the Soviet Union by breaking the stranglehold of censorship, fostering public debate,
      and exposing systemic abuses. It acted as both a catalyst for reform and a mirror revealing decades of
      suppressed grievances. Under Gorbachev’s leadership, openness became the foundation upon which
      Perestroika and new democratic mechanisms were built—yet it also accelerated centrifugal forces
      that ultimately led to the USSR’s dissolution.
