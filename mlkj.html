    <!-- 1. Early Life and Family Background -->
    <h2>Early Life and Family Background</h2>
    <p>
      Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. Raised in a deeply religious family, he was influenced early on by the values of his father, a Baptist minister, and the community around him. The struggles of African Americans in the segregated South left a lasting impression on young King, fostering his sense of justice and commitment to equality.
    </p>
    <p>
      His upbringing in a community that valued education, hard work, and spiritual growth helped shape his future as a leader who would challenge the status quo and advocate for civil rights.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. Education and Early Influences -->
    <h2>Education and Early Influences</h2>
    <p>
      King attended segregated schools in Georgia, where he excelled academically despite the systemic challenges he faced. His experiences of racial injustice sparked a lifelong passion for social equality. He went on to earn a degree in sociology from Morehouse College before studying theology at Crozer Theological Seminary and later earning a doctorate in systematic theology from Boston University.
    </p>
    <p>
      King's exposure to nonviolent activism during his college years, along with the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, deeply influenced his philosophical outlook, leading him to embrace nonviolence as the most effective tool for social change.
    </p>

    <!-- 3. The Montgomery Bus Boycott -->
    <h2>The Montgomery Bus Boycott</h2>
    <p>
      One of the earliest and most pivotal events in King’s career was the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955-1956. Sparked by Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a segregated bus, the boycott became a powerful act of resistance against racial segregation. Under King’s leadership, the boycott united the black community in Montgomery and demonstrated the potential of sustained nonviolent protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the boycott not only resulted in a Supreme Court ruling that declared bus segregation unconstitutional, but it also propelled King into the national spotlight as a prominent leader in the civil rights movement.
    </p>

    <!-- 4. Leadership in the Civil Rights Movement -->
    <h2>Leadership in the Civil Rights Movement</h2>
    <p>
      King's commitment to nonviolent resistance and his gift of powerful oratory quickly established him as a key figure in the civil rights movement. Over the following years, he led numerous campaigns against segregation, inequality, and injustice. His leadership during events such as the Birmingham Campaign and the March on Washington became defining moments in the struggle for civil rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      King's ability to inspire and mobilize millions of people through his speeches and peaceful protests underscored his deep commitment to achieving social change through moral and legal means.
    </p>

    <h2>The "I Have a Dream" Speech</h2>
    <p>
      Delivered during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the "I Have a Dream" speech is one of King's most iconic moments. In a stirring address, he articulated a vision of a future where people would be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin. The speech resonated deeply with people across the nation and the world, symbolizing the hope and determination of the civil rights movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its eloquence and timeless message continue to inspire generations and serve as a benchmark for nonviolent activism and the quest for equality.
    </p>

    <!-- 6. Nonviolent Philosophy and Influences -->

He maintained that nonviolence was both a moral imperative and the most effective means of social change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through tireless advocacy, King demonstrated that change could be achieved without resorting to hatred or aggression. His commitment to peaceful resistance remains one of his most enduring contributions to social and political movements around the world.
    </p>

    <!-- 7. Challenges, Opposition, and Sacrifices -->
