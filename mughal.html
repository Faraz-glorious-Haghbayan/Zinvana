        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Mughal Empire was founded in 1526 by Babur after his victory at Panipat and grew over the next three centuries into one of South Asia’s greatest dynasties. At its zenith in the late seventeenth century, under Aurangzeb, it encompassed nearly four million square kilometres from Kabul and Kandahar in the west to Bengal and Assam in the east, and to the Deccan Plateau in the south. The Mughals fused Central Asian, Persian and Indian traditions to create a cosmopolitan court culture, sophisticated administration, and architectural wonders that continue to define the subcontinent’s heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Central to Mughal success was a professional army composed of cavalry, infantry and artillery, and a revenue system—mansabdari and zabt—that linked land grants to military service. Persian became the court language, patronage of painters and artisans flourished, and monumental buildings such as the Taj Mahal epitomised the synthesis of Islamic and indigenous forms. Yet the empire also faced challenges: costly expansions, religious tensions and regional revolts gradually weakened central authority, leading to fragmentation and eventual colonial takeover.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="origins">Origins and Early History (1526–1605)</h2>
        <p>
          Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan, invaded from Kabul and defeated Sultan Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526. He consolidated control of Delhi and Agra, employing Ottoman-style artillery. His son Humayun initially lost territory to the Afghan noble Sher Shah Suri but later reclaimed the throne with Safavid support in 1555, before dying in 1556. Akbar (r. 1556–1605) then forged a durable state by absorbing Rajput kingdoms through marriage alliances, reorganising revenue, and promoting religious tolerance under his policy of Sulh-i Kul—peace with all.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="expansion">Expansion and Military Supremacy</h2>
        <h3>Consolidation under Akbar</h3>
        <p>
          Akbar’s generals, like Raja Man Singh and Todar Mal, subjugated Malwa, Gujarat, Bengal and parts of Central India. The Battle of Haldighati (1576) against Maharana Pratap demonstrated Mughal field tactics and cavalry charges. Mughal armies combined matchlock muskets, swivel guns and elephant corps, enabling rapid expansion.
        </p>
        <h3>Frontiers and Campaigns under Jahangir and Shah Jahan</h3>
        <p>
          Jahangir (r. 1605–1627) secured Deccan forts and repelled Portuguese in Gujarat. Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) extended control into southern India—capturing Golconda and Bijapur—and presided over architectural masterpieces. However, his Deccan campaigns were protracted and costly.
        </p>
        <h3>Peak and Overreach under Aurangzeb</h3>
        <p>
          Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) expanded the empire to its greatest extent, annexing the rest of the Deccan. Yet his long campaigns against the Marathas drained treasury and overstretched administration, sowing seeds of revolt.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="governance">Administrative Innovations</h2>
        <p>
          The Mughals employed the mansabdari system—ranking nobles by numerical mansabs that determined their military obligations and land revenue assignments (jagir). Diwans oversaw revenue collection, and qazis administered Islamic law. Provincial governance was delegated to subahs led by subahdars, with imperial inspectors ensuring accountability. Centralised record-keeping and standardised coinage facilitated trade and state finance.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="economy">Economic Foundations</h2>
        <p>
          Agriculture was the backbone: wheat, rice, cotton and indigo were revenue staples. Peasants paid land tax (zabt) in cash under Todar Mal’s reforms. Trade thrived on overland routes and within the Indian Ocean network, exporting textiles, spices and gems. Mughal ports like Surat, Hooghly and Masulipatnam linked to Persian Gulf, Red Sea and Southeast Asian markets.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="culture">Architectural and Cultural Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          Mughal architecture combined Persian iwans, Indian chhatris and local red sandstone and white marble. Key monuments include Humayun’s Tomb (1565), Fatehpur Sikri (1570s), the Taj Mahal (1632–1653) and the Red Fort (1639–1648). Gardens, mosques and palaces exemplify symmetry, calligraphic decoration and pietra dura inlay.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="science">Science, Medicine and Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Mughal courts patronised astronomy—Zij manuscripts and observatories—and medicine drawing on Unani traditions. Water-engineering projects, such as stepwells and canal networks, supported agriculture. Military innovations included matchlocks, cannon foundries and fortification improvements.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="education">Religion, Education and Intellectual Currents</h2>
        <p>
          Akbar founded the Ibadat Khana for interfaith dialogue and promulgated the Din-i Ilahi. Madrasas taught Quran, Hadith, logic and literature. Mughal chronicles—Akbarnama, Shah Jahan Nama—recorded history. Court atelier workshops produced illustrated manuscripts blending Persian and Indian styles.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="diplomacy">Diplomacy and International Relations</h2>
        <p>
          The Mughals maintained envoys with the Ottoman and Safavid courts and received Jesuit missions in Agra. They negotiated trade agreements with the English, Dutch and Portuguese East India Companies, granting them factory privileges at Surat and Madras.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="daily-life">Society and Daily Life</h2>
        <p>
          Urban elites wore Persianate robes and enjoyed court festivals. Villagers laboured in rice fields and textile workshops. Caravanserais supported merchants, while bazaars in Delhi, Agra and Lahore bustled with goods and crafts—carpets, jewelry, ceramics.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="gender">Women and Gender Roles</h2>
        <p>
          Royal women—like Nur Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal—exercised political influence and patronage. Women in urban centres managed households, textile production and trade in certain regions. Marriage alliances cemented political ties between princely states and Mughal nobility.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="scholarship">Education and Scholarship</h2>
        <p>
          Scholars translated Sanskrit classics into Persian. Libraries amassed works on theology, astronomy and medicine. The court’s patronage of historians, poets and philosophers fostered a vibrant intellectual culture.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="arts">Art, Literature and Intellectual Exchange</h2>
        <p>
          Mughal painting fused Persian miniatures with local themes. Masters like Basawan and Farrukh Beg illustrated manuscripts, while court poets composed in Persian and Braj Bhasha. Artistic exchange with Deccan and Rajput courts enriched subject matter and style.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="music">Music and Performing Arts</h2>
        <p>
          The Mughals patronised classical music forms—qawwali, dhrupad—and employed court musicians on sitar, sarod and tabla. Dance forms like Kathak evolved under court sponsorship, blending Persian elements with North Indian folk traditions.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="cuisine">Cuisine and Culinary Traditions</h2>
        <p>
          Mughal cuisine introduced rich gravies, biryanis and kebabs, combining Persian pilaf with Indian spices. Royal kitchens perfected dishes like biryani, korma and sheer khurma. Sweets such as gulab jamun and halwa became court favourites.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="infrastructure">Transportation and Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Imperial roads linked Agra, Delhi and Lahore. Caravanserais dotted major routes, providing lodging and security. Riverine transport on the Ganges and Indus facilitated movement of goods and troops.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="governance-local">Provincial Governance and Local Elites</h2>
        <p>
          Subahs were divided into sarkars and parganas, each overseen by faujdars and amils. Mansabdars and zamindars collected revenue and maintained local order. Elite families in Bengal and Gujarat played key roles in provincial administration.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="cartography">Imperial Cartography and Geography</h2>
        <p>
          Court geographers compiled regional maps for military campaigns. Persian gazetteers documented rivers, mountain passes and trade routes. European travellers such as Niccolao Manucci produced detailed accounts of Mughal territories.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="decolonization">Challenges, Reforms and Decline</h2>
        <p>
          After Aurangzeb’s death in 1707, regional powers like the Marathas, Sikhs and later the British East India Company eroded Mughal authority. Fiscal strain from continuous warfare and decentralisation of mansabs led to weakened control. By 1857, the Mughal throne was nominal, and the British suppressed the final rebellion, ending the dynasty.
        </p>
      
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Mughal Empire transformed South Asia’s political, cultural and architectural landscape. Its systems of administration, art and cuisine endured beyond its fall, influencing successor states and colonial administrations. Today, its monuments and cultural synthesis stand as enduring testaments to a remarkable era of imperial innovation and Indo-Persian grandeur.
