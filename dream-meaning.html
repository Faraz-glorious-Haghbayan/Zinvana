          <p style="line-height:1.7;color:var(--text);margin-bottom:12px;">
            Dreams have fascinated humanity for millennia. Modern psychology suggests that dreams are your brain's way of processing emotions, memories, and experiences from your waking life. When you dream about snakes, falling, flying, or teeth falling out, your subconscious mind is communicating important messages through symbolic imagery.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height:1.7;color:var(--text);">
            Our free dream interpreter uses a comprehensive database of over 1,000 dream symbols based on psychological research, cultural symbolism, and common dream patterns to help you understand what your dreams really mean.
