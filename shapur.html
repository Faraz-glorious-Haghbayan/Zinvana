    <h2>Early Life of Shapur I</h2>
    <p>
      Shapur I was born around 215 CE, son of Ardashir I and Queen Denag. He grew up at the Sassanian court in Firuzabad and Ctesiphon, receiving training in horsemanship, archery, and Zoroastrian ritual. As prince, he commanded frontier forces against nomads on the northeastern borders, gaining experience in logistics and troop leadership.
    </p>

    <h2>Accession of Shapur I to the Throne</h2>
    <p>
      Upon the death of his father Ardashir I in 242 CE, Shapur I ascended as the second Sassanian emperor. His coronation was held at Ctesiphon, where he was acclaimed by the nobility and priesthood. He immediately set out to consolidate control over the empire’s frontiers and court factions.
    </p>

    <h2>Shapur I’s Victories over Rome</h2>
    <p>
      Shapur I won two major victories against Rome. In 244 CE, he ambushed and killed Emperor Gordian III at Misiche. In 260 CE, he captured Emperor Valerian at Edessa—marking the only time a Roman emperor was taken prisoner. He paraded Valerian in a golden cage through Ctesiphon, cementing his reputation as Rome’s scourge.
    </p>

    <h2>Administrative and Religious Reforms under Shapur I</h2>
    <p>
      Shapur I reorganized the empire into more cohesive provinces, appointed capable governors, and codified tax regulations. He continued his father’s patronage of Zoroastrian clergy, building fire temples and sponsoring the codification of liturgical texts, while allowing Christian and Manichaean communities limited freedom.
    </p>

    <h2>Building the City of Bishapur</h2>
    <p>
      Around 266 CE, Shapur I founded Bishapur in Fars, designing it on a grid plan reminiscent of Roman cities. He erected a monumental triumphal arch, palatial complex, and aqueducts. The city’s bas-reliefs depict his victories over Rome and scenes of courtly life.
    </p>

    <h2>Monumental Rock Reliefs of Shapur I</h2>
    <p>
      Shapur I commissioned grand rock reliefs at Naqsh-e Rustam and Bishapur, illustrating key events: the investiture by Ahura Mazda, the Battle of Hormozdgan, and the submission of Roman emperors. These carvings blend Persian iconography with Hellenistic style.
    </p>

    <h2>Shapur I in Historical Sources</h2>
    <p>
      Roman historians (Dio Cassius, Zosimus) chronicle Shapur’s campaigns. Persian inscriptions—such as the Res Gestae Divi Saporis—provide his own account. Archaeological remains at Bishapur and Ctesiphon corroborate his architectural patronage.
    </p>

    <h2>Death of Shapur I and Succession</h2>
    <p>
      Shapur I died around 279 CE in Gundeshapur. He was succeeded by his son Hormizd I, ensuring a stable transition. His reign set the Sassanian Empire on a course of prosperity and cultural flowering.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy and Modern Appraisal of Shapur I</h2>
    <p>
      Shapur I’s decisive victories over Rome and his cultural patronage established the Sassanian Empire as Rome’s equal and a center of learning. His rock reliefs and urban foundations endure as testaments to his ambition and vision.
    </p>
