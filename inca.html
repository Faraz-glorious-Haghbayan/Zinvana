    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Inca Empire, known as Tawantinsuyu, arose in the mid-15th century under Pachacuti and came to dominate the Andean highlands and coastal deserts of South America. At its zenith ca. 1525 it extended over two million square kilometres, from modern Colombia to central Chile, governing perhaps ten million people through a highly centralised bureaucracy. The Incas integrated diverse peoples by standardising language (Quechua), religion and administrative practices, all united by an extraordinary network of roads and relay stations. Their legacy survives in monumental stone cities, agricultural terraces and social systems still evident among Andean communities.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="origins">Origins and Early History (c.1200–1438)</h2>
    <p>
      Small chiefdoms in the Cusco Valley coalesced under Manco Cápac and later rulers. Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui (r. 1438–1471) reorganised Cusco into four suyus (regions) and launched military campaigns that conquered neighbouring highland and coastal polities. His son Tupac Inca Yupanqui consolidated these gains, extending Inca authority to the Pacific coast and into Ecuador. By mid-15th century the imperial structure was in place.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="expansion">Expansion and Military Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Inca armies relied on massed infantry drawn from each ayllu (clan), equipped with clubs, slings and bronze-tipped spears. Campaigns followed the quinoa ridge roads, using integrated supply depots (tampos). Conquests were often preceded by offers of peaceful integration; defeated elites were incorporated as local governors under Inca oversight.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="governance">Administrative Innovations</h2>
    <p>
      The empire was divided into suyus, further sub-divided into wamani governed by appointed curacas (local lords). A central council in Cusco oversaw state religion, treasury and record-keeping using quipus—knotted cords encoding census and tribute data. Laws and labor obligations were uniform across the realm.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="economy">Economic Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture was organised through state and community lands. Terraced fields on Andean slopes produced potatoes, maize and quinoa. The ayllu system redistributed surplus under the principle of ayni (reciprocity). State storehouses held reserves of dried potatoes, maize, cameloid wool and coca for lean seasons and military campaigns.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="culture">Architectural and Cultural Achievements</h2>
    <p>
      Inca stonework—polygonal masonry without mortar—built palaces, fortresses and temples. Machu Picchu, Sacsayhuamán and Ollantaytambo exemplify precise engineering and astronomical alignment. Textile weaving, metallurgy of gold and silver, and pottery reflected imperial aesthetics and local traditions.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="science">Science, Medicine and Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Specialized knowledge of high-altitude agriculture led to frost-resistant crops and freeze-drying of potatoes (chuño). Inca herbalists used coca and medicinal plants for altitude sickness and fevers. Suspension bridges of braided grass spanned gorges, and road cuttings facilitated year-round travel.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="religion">Religion, Education and Intellectual Currents</h2>
    <p>
      State religion worshipped Inti (sun god) and Viracocha, with huacas (sacred sites) venerated across the realm. Capac Ñan—the royal road—was lined with shrines. Young noble sons received training at Qurikancha temple‐schools in astronomy, religion and governance.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="diplomacy">Diplomacy and Regional Alliances</h2>
    <p>
      The Incas forged alliances with powerful groups—Cañari in Ecuador, Colla on Titicaca—through diplomacy and marriage. Local elites retained status by adopting Inca dress and language, ensuring stability without constant military occupation.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="daily-life">Society and Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
      Families lived in thatched stone dwellings clustered in ayllus. Communal rituals marked planting and harvest. Markets (tianguez) in provincial centers exchanged local crafts, textiles, maize and coca leaves under state supervision.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="gender">Women and Gender Roles</h2>
    <p>
      Noble women served as aclla (chosen women) weaving textiles for the state and performing rituals. Commoner women managed household crops, textile production and childcare. Inheritance and land use rights were recognised for both genders within the ayllu.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="arts">Art, Literature and Intellectual Exchange</h2>
    <p>
      Oral tradition preserved history and mythology through amautas (wise teachers). Textile motifs encoded social and cosmological knowledge. Metalworkers produced gold sun disks and silver vessels for ritual use.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="music">Music and Performing Arts</h2>
    <p>
      Flutes (antara), panpipes (zampona) and drums (warawa) accompanied dances in huacas. Ritual ceremonies featured chicha corn beer, singing and dance dramatizing creation myths and imperial victories.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="cuisine">Cuisine and Culinary Traditions</h2>
    <p>
      Staples included potatoes, maize porridge (chicha de jora), quinoa stew and roasted guinea pig (cuy). Freeze-dried potatoes and maize were traded across regions, ensuring stable food supplies.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure and Road Networks</h2>
    <p>
      The Qhapaq Ñan spanned over 25,000 km of paved roads, linking Cusco to Quito and Santiago. Tambos provided lodging at one-day intervals. Rope suspension bridges and staircases carved into rock enabled rapid messenger relay (chasqui system).
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="labor">Mita Labor System and Provincial Elites</h2>
    <p>
      The mita required rotating labor drafts for state farms, mines and construction. Successful mitayos (laborers) gained land access and could rise to administrative posts. Curacas mediated between central authorities and local communities.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="cartography">Imperial Cartography and Geography</h2>
    <p>
      While lacking written maps, quipus and oral route descriptions guided chasquis and administrators. Landmark huacas and summit shrines served as geographic reference points in Andean cosmography.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="decline">Challenges, Conquest and Decline</h2>
    <p>
      Smallpox epidemic (1525) decimated populations. Following Huayna Capac’s death c. 1527, civil war erupted between Atahualpa and Huascar. In 1532 Francisco Pizarro exploited these divisions, capturing Atahualpa at Cajamarca and, by 1533, seizing Cusco to end the empire.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Inca Empire achieved unparalleled feats in administration, engineering and cultural synthesis across rugged Andean terrain. Its roads, terraces and stone cities endure as testaments to a sophisticated civilisation that balanced central authority with regional diversity. The Inca legacy persists in Andean languages, traditions and archaeological monuments.
