    <h2>Early Life of Khosrow II</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow II was born circa 585 CE, son of Hormizd IV and Queen Denag. Raised at the palace in Ctesiphon, he received education in Persian court etiquette, Zoroastrian ritual, and military strategy. As a prince, he governed Mesopotamian districts and trained under veteran generals, forging early alliances that would support his later accession.
    </p>

    <h2>Accession of Khosrow II to the Throne</h2>
    <p>
      In 590 CE, after a palace coup that deposed his father, Khosrow II fled to Byzantine territory. With imperial backing under Emperor Maurice, he regained Ctesiphon later that year. His gratitude to Byzantium set the stage for shifting alliances and the outbreak of renewed Roman–Persian hostilities following Maurice’s overthrow.
    </p>

    <h2>Khosrow II’s Wars against Byzantium</h2>
    <p>
      From 602–628 CE, Khosrow II led campaigns deep into Byzantine lands, capturing Antioch in 613 and Jerusalem in 614. His forces seized the True Cross, dealt a blow to Byzantine morale, and reached Egypt by 619. Early successes expanded Sassanian control, but overextension and the rise of Heraclius reversed gains by 627, culminating in the Battle of Nineveh and the loss of former territories.
    </p>

    <h2>Administrative Measures of Khosrow II</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow II sought to finance his wars through increased land taxes and tribute from subject provinces. He restructured the imperial treasury, introduced new coinage with his portrait, and held grand court festivals to reinforce loyalty. However, heavy taxation and levies to sustain military campaigns strained the peasantry and nobility alike.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Patronage under Khosrow II</h2>
    <p>
      Despite warfare, Khosrow II fostered a Persian cultural revival. He commissioned elegant rock reliefs at Taq-e Bostan depicting his investiture and royal hunts. Court poets composed panegyrics in Middle Persian, and artisans produced luxurious textiles and silverwork under royal patronage.
    </p>

    <h2>Religious and Social Policies of Khosrow II</h2>
    <p>
      A devout Zoroastrian, Khosrow II maintained the magi’s privileges and sponsored fire temple renovations. He granted limited autonomy to Christian and Jewish communities—most notably issuing decrees for the protection of Jerusalem’s Christian population under Sassanian rule.
    </p>

    <h2>Khosrow II in Historical Sources</h2>
    <p>
      Byzantine chroniclers (Theophylact Simocatta) provide detailed war accounts. Persian inscriptions and coin legends record his royal titles. Archaeological evidence at Ctesiphon and Taq-e Bostan corroborate his monumental building and relief programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Downfall and Death of Khosrow II</h2>
    <p>
      After the disastrous defeat at Nineveh in 627 CE, Khosrow II faced revolts at home. In 628 CE, he was overthrown in a palace coup led by his son Kavadh II. Imprisoned and later executed in Ctesiphon, his death plunged the empire into succession crises that hastened Sassanian collapse.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy and Modern Evaluation of Khosrow II</h2>
    <p>
      Khosrow II’s reign is remembered for its dramatic highs and lows: vast territorial expansion followed by catastrophic losses. His patronage of art and poetry marked the apogee of Sassanian culture, even as his military ambitions contributed to the empire’s terminal instability. Modern historians view him as a complex figure whose achievements and failures shaped the course of Late Antiquity.
