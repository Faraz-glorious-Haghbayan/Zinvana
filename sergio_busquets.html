    <!-- Early Life & Family Background -->
    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life &amp; Family Background</h2>
      <p>
        Born into a footballing family in Barcelona, Sergio is the son of former goalkeeper Carlos Busquets, who played for UE Lleida. Raised in the Sant Martí district, he grew up honing his vision on the narrow streets and futsal courts of his hometown, developing exceptional ball control and spatial awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        His early coaches at CF Badalona noted his ability to read the game even at age nine, tracking runners and intercepting passes with uncanny anticipation. Balancing school and youth training, he demonstrated academic discipline, excelling in subjects that emphasized analysis and strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 11, he joined Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy, where he forged key relationships with future stars and absorbed the club’s possession-based philosophy under coaches who emphasized technical refinement and footballing intelligence.
      </p>

        Progressing steadily through the U12s, U14s and U16s, Busquets impressed with his low center of gravity and ability to pivot under pressure. He captained the U19 side to a league and cup double in 2007, contributing ten goals and fifteen assists from midfield.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coaches praised his maturity; even in youth tournaments against older opponents, he marshaled teammates, dictated tempo, and distributed accurate long-range passes, foreshadowing the metronomic role he would later perfect.

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Some pundits have questioned his adaptability outside Barcelona’s possession-based system, citing his early adjustment period in MLS as evidence. However, his subsequent performances at Inter Miami quelled such doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Euro 2016, he was involved in a contentious handball incident that eliminated Italy, drawing debate over fair play and video-referee protocols; Busquets publicly called for clearer VAR guidelines thereafter.
